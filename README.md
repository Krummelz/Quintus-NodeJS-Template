Quintus NodeJS Template
=======================

[Quintus](http://html5quintus.com/) is an awesome HTML5 game engine.

This is an easy-to-use template that is set up to host your Quintus project with NodeJS using Express.

Includes Socket.IO on the server-side, and the [HiDPI polyfill](https://github.com/jondavidjohn/hidpi-canvas-polyfill) by Jonathan Johnson on the client-side.


Instructions
------------

On windows, run command prompt at the main folder, by CTRL + Shift + Right Clicking and selecting `Open command window here`

Type in `npm install` to have node's package manager install the packages referenced in the package.json file.

Once it's finished, type in `node app.js` to start the server. It runs on [http://localhost:8082/](http://localhost:8082/) by default.

The `/public/scripts/game.js` file is already set up with the minimum code required to run quintus.
